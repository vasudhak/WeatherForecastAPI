# WeatherForecastAPI
This is a list-based application where the list will be pre-populated with at least 3 different entries. There is an 'Add' button that allows the user to add additional city name into the list which fetches weather information from a weather service API (http://openweathermap.org/api). Tapping on a list item will make an API call to a weather service and display the weather data in a detail activity.
